## The HackerNoon Font

This is the source repository for HackerNoon Font: HackerNoon’s signature pixel font. The font comes in 26 letters, 10 numbers, and 31 exciting special characters.

## HackerNoon Font 2.0 is here! 

Just like the original font, HackerNoon Font 2.0, or #HF2 is designed using a five-by-five grid system in which each letter shares the same exact width and height as one another, making this font all the more unique in the first place.

However, in this version, all the edges on each letter are now 100% curved, giving the font a cleaner and more modern look. #HF2 emphasizes more on readability and usability - it is prompted to be utilized more in common settings like body text other than just headings and titles.

With #H2F, we at HackerNoon hope to keep our unique identity - a retro publication sprinkled with funkiness - but at the same time open ourselves to the modern world where soft and smooth traits speaks technology louder than hard edges.
